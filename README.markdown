## System Requirements

Mac OS X (10.6.x, 10.7.x, 10.8.x), intel(64bit/32bit) based.

## Installation

You can either download the compiled executable file from [here](https://mongohub.s3.amazonaws.com/MongoHub.zip)
or clone the source code and compile it on your own system.

## Build

Just build it, it should work (but let me know if you have an errors or warnings).

## Current Status

This project is very new. Any issues or bug reports are welcome. And I still don't have time to write a **usage guide**.

** Known bugs **
    
    - Simple quote is not supported yet for json

** To do list **
    
    - Should manage a list of database/user/password for each connections
    - Should save the password into the keychain
    - Create a document editor to edit using an outline view (like the plist editor in Xcode)
    - Need a progress bar for file export/import to know when it is done
    
** Current **

    - Default port was not set (thanks to undancer) https://github.com/fotonauts/MongoHub-Mac/issues/89
