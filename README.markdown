## What is MongoHub
**[MongoHub](http://mongohub.todayclose.com/)** is a **[mongodb](http://mongodb.org)** GUI application.
This repository is a fork of [MongoHub](https://github.com/bububa/MongoHub-Mac).

## System Requirements

Mac OS X(10.6.x or 10.7.x), intel(64bit/32bit) based.

## Installation

You can either download the compiled executable file from [here](https://github.com/downloads/fotonauts/MongoHub-Mac/MongoHub.zip) 
or clone the source code and compile it on your own system.

## Build

Just build it, it should work (but let me know if you have an errors or warnings).

## Current Status

This project is very new. Any issues or bug reports are welcome. And I still don't have time to write a **usage guide**.

    - Don't trust the grey default value in textfields
    - Most of errors are not handled correctly

** To do list **
    
    - Should manage a list of database/user/password for each connections
